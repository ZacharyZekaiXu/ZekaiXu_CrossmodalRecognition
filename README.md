### Keyword
Crossmodal Transfer Learning, RL-based Object Recognition, Latent Representation (tbc)

### Updates and Current Work to do (14/08/2022)

1. Modify the multiple object, introduce the shapes(cubes, spheres)

2. Modify the sensor input:

a. Visual: modify Lidar-senor to introduce motion parallax concept

b. Tactile: Implement whiskers-like tactiles sensor for exploring in the dark: three fixed sensor places in-front, left and right with imaginary physical properties like spring. The three whisker-like sensor record infomation including length to the contact point, tangent of the contact plane and relative distance from the mass-centre to the contact point.
